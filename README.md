## Context

This repo is a placeholder for the practice material used to illustrate the presentation "Data Science for Climate Risk Management".
The aim of this repo is to perform an analysis of extreme precipitations in the north of France from public weather data.
A strong emphasis is done on univariate and bivariate extreme value analysis, with comparison between several approaches.

## Installation

You can simply install the required dependencies by doing : 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended to use a python virtual environnement manager (conda, virtualenv, pyenv) in order to ensure reproducibility of the results.
With conda, you can simply 

```python
conda create -n [myenv] python=3.10
```

with [myenv] being your environnement name.

## Repo organization

The repo is separated into 4 notebooks that should be read in this order :
1. exploration.ipynb
2. eva.ipynb
3. copula.ipynb
4. portfolio.ipynb

The successive tasks to perform are detailed in comment for each step.
A correction will be presented during the presentation day, and forwarded after the course.

## Data

The data needed for this repo will be shared separately
